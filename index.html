          <p>I am a team player with a solution-focused approach to problem solving. After studying Computer Science at <a href="https://jacobs-university.de">Jacobs University</a>, I started out as a Software Engineer at <a href="dongxii.com">Dongxii</a>. I enabled start-up growth by rebuilding all layers of a bespoke e-commerce system using a service oriented architecture.</p>
          
          <p>More recently, I've been contributing to unlocking business value for our clients by planning and implementing digital workflows by leveraging the <a href="https://service-now.com">ServiceNow</a> platform as a part of <a href="https://dxc.technology">DXC.technology</a>.</p>

          <p>After work, I love <a href="https://strava.com/athletes/lk1">riding road bikes</a> and <a href="https://mixcloud.com/sayswithoutgoing">mixing music</a>. Previous passion pastimes primarily include <a href="https://jacobshack.com">hackathon organizing</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jacobs-university-rowing-team/">rowing</a>. I occasionally write on <a href="https://leo.codes">Medium</a>.

          <p>If you like what you're reading, please reach out! I'm always open to new opportunities. A more traditional <a href="/assets/Leonhard Kuboschek.pdf">résumé</a> is also available for you.
